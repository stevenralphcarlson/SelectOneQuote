# Quote Web Application
This Web application takes in an origin input and a destination input from a form. It then passes that form input to Google's [Distance Matrix API] (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/start), where the origin and the destination gets calculated for it's distance between the two points.

## Azure web services

The web application is still under development however I have deployed it to Azure web services.  I have set up a synchronous deployment method for deploying to Azure. When committing new changes to github that package gets uploaded to Azure where it is passed into the live environment.  

## Upcoming

I plan on adding a check out page, where users can purchase vehicle transportation by using a credit card check out processor.
